search.php+server.php- some of the php scripts from a website I designed, includes account creation/searching with SQL
Hi, my name is Harry McCaffery. I am student at Northern Michigan University.  Here is a repository with a few examples of my code in different languages.

BBMHasciiconv.asm- x8086 machine code, takes a keypress as input and outputs ascii code for that key.  A little more complex than it sounds.

Gun.cs- an old C# script that I wrote for a unity game that handles weapon related things.

NQueenSolver.java- written for a class, helps solve a chess problem

Seeker.java+SeekerTest.java- an implementation of Binary Search and a function for testing
